# Baymax-ray.github.io

A Github Pages template for personal pages. Inspired by [Sadee](https://github.com/codewithsadee) from [vCard](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio). vCard is a fully responsive personal portfolio website, responsive for all devices.

I made some modification to the template. Now, you can receive email from the contact form.

Please feel free to fire issues or make pull requests if you want to improve the generic template / theme.
